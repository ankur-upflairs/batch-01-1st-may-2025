📘 JavaScript Assignment: Destructuring, Rest, Spread, Date, Math
💡 Instructions:
Answer each question with either an explanation or a code solution.

Run and test your code in a JavaScript environment (e.g., browser console, Node.js, or online JS playground).

Try to understand why each feature works the way it does.

🧩 Section 1: Destructuring (Questions 1–5)
1. Object Destructuring:
Given the object:

js
Copy
Edit
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "New York" };
Use destructuring to extract name and age into variables.

2. Array Destructuring:
Given the array:

js
Copy
Edit
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
Use array destructuring to assign the first and second colors to variables.

3. Default Values:
Destructure the object below and give country a default value of "USA" if it's not present.

js
Copy
Edit
const person = { name: "Bob", age: 30 };
4. Nested Destructuring:
Use destructuring to extract city from the object:

js
Copy
Edit
const employee = {
  name: "Eve",
  address: {
    city: "Chicago",
    zip: "60601"
  }
};
5. Swap Variables:
Use array destructuring to swap the values of a and b:

js
Copy
Edit
let a = 1;
let b = 2;
🌀 Section 2: Rest & Spread (Questions 6–10)
6. Rest Operator in Functions:
Write a function that takes any number of arguments and returns their sum using the rest operator.

7. Array Spread:
Combine two arrays using the spread operator:

js
Copy
Edit
const fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
const berries = ["blueberry", "strawberry"];
8. Object Spread:
Merge the two objects using the spread operator:

js
Copy
Edit
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = { b: 3, c: 4 };
9. Clone an Array:
Use the spread operator to clone the following array:

js
Copy
Edit
const original = [1, 2, 3];
10. Function with Rest + Destructuring:
Write a function that takes a user object and any number of hobbies, and prints the user's name and the hobbies.

🗓️ Section 3: Date (Questions 11–13)
11. Current Date and Time:
Write a code snippet to print the current date and time.

12. Extract Year and Month:
From the current date, extract and print the year and month.

13. Format a Date:
Create a date object for January 1, 2025, and format it as "2025-01-01".

🧮 Section 4: Math (Questions 14–15)
14. Random Number:
Generate a random integer between 1 and 100.

15. Find Max and Min:
Use the Math object to find the maximum and minimum values in this array:

js
Copy
Edit
const numbers = [23, 89, 4, 56, 12];
